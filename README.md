**[Live Demo](https://tribeworkout.netlify.app/)** | **[Product Hunt Launch](https://www.producthunt.com/products/fittribe-2/launches/fittribe-2)**

**FitTribe** is an open-source, AI-powered holistic wellbeing and fitness tracking platform built with React 19, Supabase, and Google Gemini AI. Designed as a "digital campfire" for close-knit communities, FitTribe goes beyond traditional workout trackers by gamifying both physical fitness (strength training, cardio) and mental wellness (creativity, meditation, cooking) in a cozy, panda-themed interface.

Whether you are looking for an open-source alternative to standard fitness apps, a gamified habit tracker, or a reference architecture for building offline-first PWAs with React and Supabase, FitTribe has you covered.

## 🌟 What Makes FitTribe Different? (Features)

Most health apps separate physical fitness from mental wellness. FitTribe brings them together into a single, supportive ecosystem with the following core features:

* **Holistic Activity Tracking:** Log everything from heavy strength training and running to "Wellbeing Actions" like painting, reading, or meditating.
* **AI-Powered Fitness & Diet Planning:** Integrated with **Google Gemini AI**, the "Sage Panda" assistant generates highly personalized weekly workout routines and diet plans based on your unique goals and real-time feedback.
* **Gamification & Virtual Economy:** Earn growth points for consistency. Unlock custom badges, send virtual gifts to your tribe members, and purchase cozy new UI themes.
* **Social Community Dynamics:** Build a "Tribe" to contribute to global Team Streaks and Tribe Goals. Every member's effort counts in this non-competitive, supportive environment.
* **Adaptive AI Guidance:** Log your post-workout reflections and let the AI gently adjust the intensity of your future routines based on your fatigue or soreness levels.
* **Offline-First PWA:** Built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with optimistic UI updates. Your workout logs save instantly and sync automatically when your internet connection is restored.
